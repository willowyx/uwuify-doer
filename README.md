# What is uwuify-doer??

### Good question! It's a Firefox and Chrome extension that turns everything into uwu-speak!

<br>

# ...why would I want that

It makes the boring internet jump alive with whimsical uwu-speak and such :3

You can also turn off the perma-uwu mode so it only activates when you choose!

<br>

# what are the main features?

### Glad you asked!

* perma-uwu mode
* extra uwu mode
* site whitelist
* convenient keyboard shortcuts
* profound sense of accomplishment(?)

<br>

# help why no work

### [Shoot me an email](mailto:haii@willowyx.dev) and I'll try and help.

As a general rule of thumb, for security reasons uwuify won't work on privileged domains like ```chrome://``` or ```about:```
