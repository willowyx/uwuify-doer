# What is uwuify-doer??

### Good question! It's a Firefox and Chrome extension that turns everything into uwu-speak!

<br>

# ...why would I want that

It makes the boring internet jump alive with whimsical uwu-speak and such :3

<br>

# are there more features planned?

### *probably*

I'm not entirely sure if I'll be able to implement too many other things, Javascript being my mortal enemy and all that. I'll try though.

<br>

# help why no work :\(

### [Shoot me an email](mailto:haii@willowyx.dev) and I'll try and help.

As a general rule of thumb, for security reasons uwuify won't work on privileged domains like these:
- `about:`
- `chrome://`
- `*.firefox.com`
- `chrome.google.com/*`

<br>

## do you have a homepage for this extension?

### [why yes, in fact, I do](https://willowyx.dev/projects/uwuify)

The site also has some more FAQs and screenshots if you were seeking additional information :3
